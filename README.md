IZPHP
=====

IZPHP - a very is intended to be a very light-weight php framework. It is certain that there are heaps of frameworks available on the Internet to help developers create beautiful applications easily but most of them are not understood by intermediate programmers. The aim for IZPHP is to create an open source php framework that help programmers in their projects by just some file inclusions and calling some functions. I hope it sounds interesting.
